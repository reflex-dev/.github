## What is Reflex

Reflex is a new open-source framework that empowers developers to build full-stack web applications entirely in pure Python—no JavaScript or web development experience required.

Developers can now build both their frontend and backend—in just one language (pip install reflex). Build anything from internal data/AI apps to large public-facing web apps and deploy with a single command (reflex deploy).

Our mission is to simplify web development by creating an ecosystem of open-source tools and hosted services that enable Python developers to build web apps faster without compromising on customizability, flexibility, or performance.

Reflex provides high-level customizable UI components, database management, and AI agents to help you create, edit, and deploy your apps 10x faster than traditional web development. To learn more, visit reflex.dev.

## Why we started Reflex

Web apps are the most common way for developers to share their ideas. But even for skilled engineers, without experience in traditional frontend tools like Javascript or React, making a web app can be overwhelming and time-consuming.

Over the years, many low-code and no-code frameworks have tried to make web development more accessible, but they all have limitations and graduation risks compared to standard web frameworks. With Reflex, we have created a framework that lets developers leverage their existing Python skills to build and deploy apps without compromising flexibility or customization.

Reflex allows you to make anything from a small data science project to a full-scale, multi-page web app. Since Reflex apps compile down to traditional frontend frameworks, there's no constraint on the type of apps you can build. Instead of reinventing the web development ecosystem, we're trying to make the existing ecosystem more accessible.

## What We are Working on

- **Core Framework:** We will continue to grow our open-source framework to have feature parity with traditional front-end frameworks. This includes adding more complex styling methods like detailed animations and improvements to our core component library.
- **Hosting Service:** The open-source project is only half the vision. In the upcoming months, we will build and release a beta of our hosting service so users can quickly deploy, scale, and share their apps. Our primary focus areas for our hosting service are security, reliability, and optimizing app performance by running our app close to the user on the edge.
