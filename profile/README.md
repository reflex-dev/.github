Reflex is an open-source framework for making web apps in pure Python.

## Why we started Reflex

Web apps are the most common way for developers to share their ideas. But even for skilled engineers, without experience in traditional frontend tools like Javascript or React, making a web app can be overwhelming and time-consuming. And once their app is created, deploying it is often a nightmare.

Over the years, many low-code and no-code frameworks have tried to make web development more accessible, but they all have limitations and graduation risks compared to standard web frameworks. With Reflex, we have created a framework that lets developers leverage their existing Python skills to build and deploy apps without compromising on flexibility or customization.

Reflex allows you to make anything from a small data science project to a full-scale, multi-page web app. Since Reflex apps compile down to traditional frontend frameworks, there's no constraint on the type of apps you can build. Instead of reinventing the web development ecosystem, we're trying to make the existing ecosystem more accessible.

## What We are Working on
- **Core Framework:** We will continue to grow our open-source framework to have feature parity with traditional front-end frameworks. This includes adding more complex styling methods like detailed animations and improvements to our core component library.
- **Rapid Onboarding:** Our goal is to be the easiest way to build web apps. We're working on adding base app templates, higher-level components, and built-in styles so developers can go from an idea to a working app as fast as possible.
- **Reflex Hosting:** The open-source project is only half the vision. In the upcoming months, we will build and release a beta of our hosting service so users can quickly deploy, scale, and share their apps. Our primary focus areas for our hosting service are security, reliability, and optimizing app performance by running our app close to the user on the edge.
